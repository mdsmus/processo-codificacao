A codification for music structures with a high degree of abstraction
is yet unheard in the field of computer music. This paper describes
the research where domain specific languages have been created using
Lisp to test possibilities of codifications according to a bottom-up
model. That is, different aspects of a codification are tested in a
prototype and it's utility is validated or rejected. For the moment
some sub-problems have been identified with the help of this approach,
such as the use of events, codification of durations, and vertical
codification. The use of free software tools helps with the
organization and dynamism of this research. All code produced by this
